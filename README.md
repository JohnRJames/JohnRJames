- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnRJames
- 👀 I’m interested in state estimation and control of distributed cyber-physical systems and computable models of human intent for use in human-robot teaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning use of autonomy engines for use in in an internationally-unique testbed for maturing artificial intelligence for use in human-robot teams.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on securely sharing state estimation and control data for resilient control of collaborative and distributed cyber-physical systems while enabling protection of selected domain information. 
- 📫 How to reach me: john.james@westpoint.edu
